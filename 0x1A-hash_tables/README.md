0x1A. C - Hash tables

A hash table is a data structure that associates keys with values by utilizing the hash value of the key, determined through a hash function. This hash value is then used to locate a specific bucket where one or more values are stored.

	Task 0:
		Write a function that creates a hash table.
	Task 1:
		Write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.
	Task 2:
		Write a function that gives you the index of a key.
		(using the division methon "modulo size")
